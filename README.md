This app contains two wager/gambling games where user has to start the game and enter into it.

Both games need different amount of ETH to enter into game. If user1 enters, and user2 doesn't join the game, user1 can withdraw his ETH. Winner get amount of user1+user2. Winner calculation might take a while due to chainlink oracles 


This project is based on ethereum blockchain, and deployed on Rinkeby. So make sure you've connected your metamask to rinkeby network.
